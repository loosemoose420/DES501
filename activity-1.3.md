# Activity 1.3

In terms of jobs that I would find myself more interested in would be jobs to do with Networking. I.e Network engineer or Administration if those positions weren't available I would like to do Cloud Administration or if I needed to start somewhere smaller a technical support role would suit me but I would not like to be operating a live chat help desk as such. I prefer to do a lot of hands on work. These jobs are quite high paying jobs and require a lot of different skills from job to job, so finding something that I fully fit into could be quite difficult.
