What different types of IT businesses exist today? What are each of their areas of focus? What products or services do they provide? How do they differ from one another? How might you categorise them?



Slingshot, Slingshot is the 4th largest telecom company in New Zealand, they provide broadband power and mobile services to customers, to differ in this category of companies is quite difficult but for slingshot I can see that they are offering a free HP Chromebook to customers that sign up to a specific plan for a period of time. They also let you pay your bill when you want, whether that be weekly fortnightly or monthly, which I haven't seen another telecomms company offer that. I would categorize them as a service and product provider.
